It's about getting Region and Island of the place based on the user's input. It also shows the location via map.

I used the geoapify to generate api key to retrieve information, under geocoding, curl, I'm able to fetch information.
But showing the name of an Island is not working, it always says "Unknown Island" even if it's already hard coded and listed in an array to determin which island it is. Some of places like Caraga, it shows the Island name.
In addition, the picture in the map is viewing the current place that the users inputed.
And for my backend, the programming language I used is PHP, for designing or frontend is CSS.

Here, you can search any places, and get the result below.
